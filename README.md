## About The Project

This is a web application I developed for my Web Programming midterm project. It acts as a Wiki for the Rick and Morty universe, allowing users to browse characters, locations, and episodes using the public Rick and Morty API.

I built this project to practice **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **API integration** concepts we learned in class.

## Features

- **Characters Page:** Lists all characters with their images and status. You can search by name or filter by status/gender.
- **Locations & Episodes:** Separate pages to browse locations and episodes with pagination.
- **Detail View:** Clicking on a character shows detailed information about them.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on mobile and desktop. I added a custom hamburger menu for mobile view.
- **Dark Mode:** The UI is designed with a dark theme to match the show's aesthetic.

## Tech Stack

* **React (Vite)**
* **Tailwind CSS** for styling
* **React Router DOM** for navigation
* **Rick and Morty API** for data
